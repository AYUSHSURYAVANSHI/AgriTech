# Agri-Tech IoT Farming Solution

Welcome to Agri-Tech, where we integrate sustainable practices and cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize modern farming. Our goal is to empower farmers with real-time insights and automated management, enhancing productivity, efficiency, and sustainability in agriculture.

## Overview

Agri-Tech's IoT farming solution combines hardware and software innovations to address key challenges faced by farmers. By leveraging IoT devices, data analytics, and machine learning, we enable farmers to make informed decisions and optimize resource usage for increased yields and reduced costs.

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Utilize soil moisture sensors to measure moisture levels in real-time, enabling precise irrigation scheduling and water conservation.
  
- **Automated Pest Control:** Implement object detection algorithms using TensorFlow and Keras to identify pests and trigger automated pest control measures, minimizing crop damage.

- **Crop Health Imaging:** Employ drones or localized sensors equipped with cameras to capture images of crops, enabling early detection of diseases and nutrient deficiencies for timely interventions.

- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:** Monitor temperature and humidity using DHT sensors to ensure optimal growing conditions, maximizing crop yield and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface.
  
- **Back-end:** Django framework for server-side logic and API endpoints, facilitating seamless communication between the front-end and IoT devices.

- **Hosting:** Replit for hosting the Django application, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

- **Database:** Aiven for managed database services, storing and managing IoT data securely.

- **Object Detection:** TensorFlow and Keras libraries for object detection, enabling automated pest control and crop health monitoring.

## IoT Components

- **ESP8266 Microcontroller:** A low-cost chip with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities for data collection and device control, serving as the core component of our IoT solution.

- **Relay Module:** Controls the water pump based on soil moisture readings, enabling automated irrigation.

- **Water Pump:** Provides irrigation based on soil moisture levels, ensuring optimal moisture levels for crop growth while conserving water resources.

- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Measures soil moisture to optimize watering, preventing both over- and under-irrigation for efficient water usage.

- **DHT Sensor:** Monitors temperature and humidity for ideal growing conditions, enabling proactive adjustments to maintain crop health.

## Getting Started

To deploy and use the Agri-Tech IoT farming solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both the front-end and back-end components.
3. Set up the database using Aiven.
4. Connect the IoT devices (ESP8266 Microcontroller, Relay Module, Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT Sensor) and ensure proper configuration.
